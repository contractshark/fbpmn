formal tools for BPMN

## Requisites

You will need to have `stack` installed on your machine to compile the source code (binaries are generated by CI but not saved for use). See [here](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/). For Windows, due to a bug (not related to fbpmn), please use:

```shell
curl -sS -ostack.zip -L --insecure https://www.stackage.org/stack/windows-x86_64
7z x stack.zip stack.exe
```

## Getting source files

You can get the source code from [here](https://github.com/pascalpoizat/fbpmn) by clicking the "Clone or download" button.

You can also use the [`git` command](https://git-scm.com/downloads) as follows:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/pascalpoizat/fbpmn
```

## Compiling

```shell
cd fbpmn
stack build
stack install
```

This will install the `fbpmn` command in some place that depends on your OS.
You can use `stack path --local-bin` to find out which directory it is.
Do not forget to put this directory in your command path.

## BPMN models

We are currently developping a BPMN-XML (the standard format) to BPMN-JSON (the one we use here) transformation to ease the process.
For the moment, we deal with BPMN models in a BPMN-JSON format as follows: 

```
{
  "name": "name of the process/collaboration",
  "messages": [ list of messages names (strings) ],
  "nodes": [ list of node ids (strings) ],
  "edges": [ list of edge ids (strings) ],
  "nameN": {},
  "catN": { couples id : type (both strings), giving node categories, should be defined for each node },
  "catE": { couples id : type (both strings), giving edge categories, should be defined for each edge },
  "sourceE": { couples edge id : node id, giving sources of edges, should be defined for each edge },
  "targetE": { couples edge id : node id, giving targets of edges, should be defined for each edge },
  "messageE": { couples edge id : message name, should be defined for each message flow edge }, 
  "containN": { map pool name : list of node ids, where pool name should be in nodes, giving direct containment relation for nodes },
  "containE": { map pool name : list of edge ids, where pool name should be in nodes, giving direct containment relation for edges },
}
```

Node categories are:

```
SubProcess | Process |
AbstractTask | 
SendTask | ReceiveTask | ThrowMessageIntermediateEvent | CatchMessageIntermediateEvent | 
XorGateway | OrGateway | AndGateway | EventBasedGateway |
NoneStartEvent | MessageStartEvent | NoneEndEvent | TerminateEndEvent | MessageEndEvent
```

Edge categories are:

```
NormalSequenceFlow | ConditionalSequenceFlow | DefaultSequenceFlow | MessageFlow
```

Examples of models are given here: [models/json-origin](models/json-origin).

To help in writing the JSON format, `fbpmn` has a very basic output to the format of the `dot` command ([graphviz format](https://graphviz.org)).
To transform a JSON file into DOT, run:

```shell
fbpmn json2dot sourcefile targetfile
```

where neither `sourcefile` nor `targetfile` have a suffix (the correct ones will be added by `fbpmn`).
Then provided you have `dot` installed, you can generate a picture for your collaboration, using:

```shell
dot -Tpng sourcefile.dot -o targetfile.png
```

## Verification using TLA+

This is achieved in two steps.

![Transformation overview.](overview.png)

### Generating the TLA+ representation of a BPMN model

To transform a BPMN collaboration model (in our JSON format) into TLA+ for verification, run:

```shell
fbpmn json2tla sourcefile targetfile
```

where neither `sourcefile` nor `targetfile` have a suffix (the correct ones will be added by `fbpmn`).
`fbpmn` also has a REPL mode (run it using `fbpmn repl`) including the following commands (**subject to evolution**):

```
quit (quit REPL)
help (list commands)
load (load current graph from JSON and verify file)
json (save current graph to JSON)
dot  (save current graph to DOT)
tla  (save current graph to TLA+)
```

In the REPL you have to specify the full name of the files (including the `.json` or `.tla` suffix).

### Verification

For verification you will need:

- the TLA+ tools, get file `tla2tools.jar` from: [https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/releases](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/releases)
- the TLA+ implementation of our FOL semantics: [theories/tla](theories/tla).

1. create a directory
2. copy files from `theories/tla` into it
3. copy the file generated by `fbpmn` into it
4.
